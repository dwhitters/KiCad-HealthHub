# KiCad-HealthHub
Schematic and PCB layout for the health hub.

## Overview
This PCB provides basic signal processing for an ECG input. The processed signal is then fed into a bluetooth module that can be used to provide data to a corresponding phone app, such as https://github.com/DaveAldon/Health-Hub-Mobile. Additional microcontroller pins are broken out to facilitate development of additional features.
